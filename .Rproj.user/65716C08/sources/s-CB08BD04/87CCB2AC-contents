I used the data and follow the general tutorial of this website:

https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/tutorials/actor-partner-interdependence-model-apim-basic-dyadicbivariate-analysis

and these following referneces:

https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/actor-partner-interdependence-model-r-mental-and-physical-health-spouses

https://rdrr.io/github/RandiLGarcia/dyadr/man/apim.html

https://randilgarcia.github.io/week-dyad-workshop/Distinguishable.html#distingushable_dyads

However, I try to explain by myself and make changes. 

# Overview
Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM)

APIM model for distinguishable dyads. 
(Two intercept approach)

## Prepare for analysis

packages 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)   
library(nlme)     
library(psych)     
library(reshape)   
library(dplyr)


```

data download

```{r}
filepath <- "https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/sites/qdev/files/wisc3raw_gender.csv"
wisc4raw<-read.csv(file=url(filepath), header=T)

data<-wisc4raw[,c("id","verb1","verb6","perfo1","perfo6")]

print(head(data,10))
```


data reshaping

```{r}

data_long <- reshape(data = data,
                    varying = c("verb1", "verb6",
                                "perfo1", "perfo6"),
                    timevar = c("grade"), 
                    idvar = c("id"),
                    direction = "long", sep="")

print(head(data_long,10))


```

 
##  Research Questions

*Actor effect*


1) verbal ability in the grade 1 can predict verbal ability in 6 grade?  
2) performance ability in the garde 1 can predict performance ability in 6 grade?  

*Partner effect*



3) verbal ability in the grade 1 can predict performance ability in 6 grade?  
4) performance ability in the 1 grade can predict verbal abilit in 6 grade  

## Basic descript stats before analysis


Basic stats 
```{r}
describe(data$verb1)
describe(data$verb6)
describe(data$perfo1)
describe(data$perfo6)
```
Correlation

```{r}

cor(data[, 2:5])
pairs.panels(data[, c("verb1", "verb6", "perfo1", "perfo6")])
```
Visualization

```{r}

data_long %>%
  subset(id <=9) %>%
  ggplot( aes( x= grade, group=id), legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(x=grade, y=verb), shape = 17, size= 3, color = "blue") +
  geom_point(aes(x=grade, y=perfo), shape = 19, size= 3, color = "green") +
  geom_line(aes(x=grade, y=verb), lty= 1, size=1, color = "blue") +
  geom_line(aes(x=grade, y=perfo), lty= 1, size = 1, color="green") +
  xlab("grade") +
  ylab("verbal/performance ability") +
  ylim(0,80) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= seq(0,7, by = 1)) +
  theme_classic () +
  facet_wrap( ~id)
```
##   Data prepare


```{r}

data_melt <- reshape::melt(data=data,
                           id.vars=c("id","verb1","perfo1"),
                           na.rm=F)

print(head(data_melt,10))



```

```{r}

colnames(data_melt)[4:5]<-c("grade6_variable","grade6_score")
data_melt<-data_melt[order(data_melt$id, data_melt$grade6_variable),]
print(head(data_melt,10))


```

Creating dummy variable for further analysis

```{r}

data_melt$verb_on <- ifelse(data_melt$grade6_variable == "verb6", 1, 0)
data_melt$perform_on <- ifelse(data_melt$grade6_variable == "perfo6", 1, 0)
print(head(data_melt,10))


```

## APIM ANALYSIS
The website's explanation is not detailed enough for understand.
Here is some steps for undertanding this model.

1) DV= Grade 6 outcome. 
2) We have both Verbal, and performance.

### The big equation for two-intercept Approach

** note **
The equation from the website and my equation from my head
has difference (# of residual)

3) the Equations are like:


So when “verb_on” is equal to 0:
$$ Grade6outcome_{ij} = VerbOn_{ij}*(\beta_{v0} + \beta_{v1}(Verb1)_{ij}+\beta_{v2}(Perform1)+e_{vj}) + PerformOn_{ij}*(\beta_{p3}+\beta_{p4}(perform1)_{ij}+
\beta_{p5}(verb1)_{ij}+e_{vj})$$

**VerbOn=Dummy __ variable (Verb=1, not=0)**  
**PerformOn=Dummy varaible (Perform=1, not=0)**

### Performance 
4) Thus, when verbOn = 0:
$$ Grade6outcome_{ij} =  PerformOn_{ij}*(\beta_{p3}+\beta_{p4}(perform1)_{ij}+
\beta_{p5}(verb1)_{ij}+e_{pj})$$

$\beta_{p3}$ is Verbal's intercept 
$\beta_{p4}$ the actor effect on perform
$\beta_{p5}$ the partner effect on perform
$e_{pj}$ Perform's residual in person J


### Verbal 
5) When the PerformOn is 0: 

$$ Grade6outcome_{ij} = VerbOn_{ij}*(\beta_{v0} + \beta_{v1}(Verb1)_{ij}+\beta_{v2}(Perform1)_{ij}+e_{vj}) $$
$\beta_{v0}$ is Verbal's intercept 
$\beta_{v1}$ the actor effect on verbal
$\beta_{v2}$ the partner effect on verbal 
$e_{vj}$ verb's residual in person J

 

```{r}

apim_full <- gls(grade6_score ~   -1+   #no intercept 
                                 verb_on +      #verbal intercept
                                 verb_on:verb1 +  #verbal actor 
                                 verb_on:perfo1 + #performance  effect
                   
                                 perform_on + #performance intercept
                                 perform_on:perfo1 + #performance actor
                                 perform_on:verb1,  #verbal partner
               correlation = corSymm(form=~1|id),
               weights = varIdent(form=~1|verb_on), #allow for different error terms (error varianace ) for the two variables/or two members. in this case, V and P 
               data = data_melt,
               na.action = na.exclude)

# The reason why here use : rather than *
# "Using * will force R to add the main effects, while : will only give you that specific interaction you’re asking for."

###  Results interpretation

**intercept** :   
19.869325  : expected verbal score at grade 6 when grade 1 verb/perfo scores are zero.   
30.049124  : expected perforamce score at grade 6 when grade 1 verb/perfo scores are zero.  


**verb_on:verb1	0.809886**   
1 point increase in verbal grade 1 is associated with 0.81 difference in verbal 6  
**verb_on:perfo1	0.446064**     
every 1 point increase in perfo grade 1 is assoicated with 0.45 diff in verbal 6 

**perfo1:perform_on 	0.962419**   
1 point increase in performance grade 1 is associated with 0.96 diff in perfo 6  
**verb1:perform_on	0.182846	**   
non-sig.
