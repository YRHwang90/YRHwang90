# Overview

In this portfolio, I aimed to be familiar with regression, especially when the DV is non-normal.
Especially, this project will investigate when the DV is binomial. (which menas that DV is just 0 or 1)

A conventional regression (OLS) assumes that DV follows normal distribution. However, if DV does not follow normal distribution, it violates this assumption.

Of Course, if the sample size is large enough, linear regression remains sounds (source: https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2128171)


## package

```{r setup, include=FALSE} 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
```

```{r}


library(psych)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

## load the data

```{r}
filepath <- "https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/sites/qdev/files/wisc3raw_gender.csv"
wisc3raw <- read.csv(file=url(filepath),header=TRUE)

## select the information that we need
wiscsub <- wisc3raw[ , c("id","verb1","verb2","verb4","verb6","momed","grad", "female")]

describe(wiscsub)



```

If the outcome variable is binary, using the logistic link function seems to be recommended.

```{r}

model1<-glm(grad~1 + verb1 + female + verb1*female, 
            famil='binomial',
            data=wiscsub,
            na.action=na.exclude)

summary(model1)

```

```{r}

coef(model1)
exp(coef(model1))
```
This binomial regression modelded the variable to log(odds) to Y to be 1. 
To interpret easily, I put exp() function to the coef.

one unit increase in verb1 score may increase the odds of DV by 1.09538103. 


### plot

```{r}

ggplot(data=wiscsub,
       aes(x=verb1, y=grad, color =factor(female)))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=5) +
  xlab("verbal score") + 
  ylab("mother's graduation")+
  guides(color=guide_legend(title="Female"))+
  theme_bw()+
  stat_smooth(method='glm',methodarges=list(family='binomial',se=TRUE, fullrange=TRUE))

```

so far so good

## twist

This is the link functioin, the logit. 
```{r}

logit<-function(p){
  log(p/(1-p))
}

```
